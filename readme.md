# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was designed so that any one looking to travel would be able to see the  weather outlook for multiple cities so that they could plan a trip accordingly.  Our class was asked  to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS and using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities that the user enters into the search bar.
